# PythonForVideoMemos

Python iOS framework for Video Memos app.

## Usage

1. Add libs folder "PythonForVideoMemos" to Xcode project w/ "Create groups" option.

2. Extend the added group, remove references of the "python" folder from "PythonForVideoMemos" (just leave those *.a files there).

3. Re-add "python" folder back w/ "Create folder references" option.

  Tips:
  - This step makes sure those included lib files will be grouped under compiled app package.
  - Make sure no *.pyc files added.

4. Add required *.tbd files:

  4.1. Select project target
  4.2. Select "Build Phases"
  4.3. Extend "Link Binary With Libraries" section
  4.4. Add files: libsqlite3.tbd, libz.tbd

5. Update Project Settings:

  - HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS:  Add '$(PROJECT_DIR)/path/to/PythonForVideoMemos/python' (recursive)
  - LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS: Add '$(PROJECT_DIR)/path/to/PythonForVideoMemos'    (non-recursive)

## 3rd Party Packages for Python

If need to add 3rd party packages for Python, just add it under

> PythonForVideoMemos/python/lib/python3.8/site-packages/

README.txt under "site-packages" folder:

> This directory exists so that 3rd party packages can be installed here.
> Read the source for site.py for more details.

## Further Reading

### About *.a file

These static libs will be compile-time-linked.

- libpython3.a: Main cross-compiled Python lib for iOS, its related header & resource files are stored in "python" folder.

- [libffi.a](https://sourceware.org/libffi/): FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. It is the popular name for the interface that allows code written in one language to call code written in another language.

- [libcrypto.a & libssl.a](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Libcrypto_API): OpenSSL provides two primary libraries: libssl and libcrypto. The libcrypto library provides the fundamental cryptographic routines used by libssl. You can however use libcrypto without using libssl.

Tips: If want to take look at *.a file, use cmd (refer to ["Contents of a static library"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3757108/contents-of-a-static-library)):

  $ nm libxxx.a | less

### About *.tbd file

These files associate to related dynamic libs, which will be runtime-linked.

`.tbd` (Text-Based Dylib) files are new "text-based stub libraries", that provide a much more compact version of the stub libraries for use in the SDK, and help to significantly reduce its download size. Refer to ["Why Xcode 7 shows *.tbd instead of *.dylib?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31450690/why-xcode-7-shows-tbd-instead-of-dylib).
